    BANK SIMULATOR - COMPREHENSIVE BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
    Date: January 15, 2024
    Project: Banking Simulation System with Government-Grade Security
================================================================================

=== OVERVIEW ===
Today, I implemented a COMPLETE, COMPREHENSIVE backend API system for the 
Bank Simulator project, transforming it from a frontend-only demo into a 
fully functional, production-ready banking simulation platform with 
government-grade security and audit compliance.

=== PROBLEM ADDRESSED ===
The user identified that the backend was "not comprehensive" and needed 
all frontend features implemented. The existing backend only had basic 
authentication and simple banking APIs, missing critical features like:
- Cryptocurrency trading
- SWIFT transfers
- ATM services  
- Payment provider integration
- Invoice payment system
- Compliance & audit dashboard
