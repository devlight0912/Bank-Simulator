- **CSRF Protection**: Double-submit cookies, SameSite strict mode

#### Authorization ✅
- **RBAC Implementation**: User, Premium, Business, Admin roles
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Session Validation**: All sensitive operations require token validation

### 2. ✅ Data Security (At Rest & In Transit)

#### Encryption in Transit ✅
